                <p><strong style="color: #AF0000;">Robert L Buckingham, MD, FACP</strong> is a board-certified specialist in internal medicine and has been in medical practice for 44 years in Ojai, California. During this time, he has been actively involved in the local community hospital serving as Chief of Staff and various committee chairs, as well as being involved in numerous civic groups. In 1993, he was elected one of the first Living Treasures of Ojai and in 2009 became a Fellow of the American College of Physicians.</p>

                <p>In 2013, Dr. Buckingham returned to basic research in the physiology and chemistry of cellular networks, focusing on how interstitial spaces respond to and eliminate inflammation. By 2017, he developed a theory that capillary cells specifically, and endothelial cells generally, manage multiple anti-inflammatory purposes through a rhythmic pivot and swing dance step rhythm involving outer membrane permeability shifts and mitochondrial combustion swings between energy and nitric oxide. Since developing the pivot and swing dance step theory, Dr. Buckingham has published four books, as well as several abstracts and peer-reviewed journal articles on the implications of this rhythm in combating end-organ interstitial space inflammation.</p>

            <p style="color: #FFC700; font-size: 20px;">Biography</p>
            <div class="biography-oamoments">
                <p>My passion is treating patients by providing individualized strategies to help them succeed. My practice career
                    spanning 4 decades has offered a rarified perspective of health care delivery, as I have been responsible for
                    patients requiring intensive care, managed care and then those that require comfort care. The gamut of care
                    delivery has enabled me to have access to all the advances in medical diagnostics and treatments as well as
                    first -hand experience in evaluating hundreds if not thousands of cardiac and carotid ultrasounds and sleep
                    studies.</p>
                <p>These experiences in health care delivery, have given me an unprecedented perspective on inflammatory risk
                    factors to health and has motivated me to write books addressing the cause and effect of inflammatory lifestyles
                    to many of the chronic illnesses we face as we age. The recurrent themes that are addressed in these first- line
                    vascular inflammatory risks include diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension, cigarette smoking, alcohol
                    and drug abuse, elevations in LDL cholesterol and other lipoproteins, inactivity, poorly managed diet, excessive
                    stress and inadequate sleep from sleep apnea or insomnia. All of these inflammatory mediator-risks are
                    modifiable by intentional lifestyle choices and in some cases medicines, supplements and positive pressure
                    breathing.</p>
                <p>This preventative path to health care has become my passion, as so many chronic health conditions are either
                    initiated or facilitated by these risks. My goal is to make as many people as I can aware of these toxic risks and
                    make adjustments before getting boxed in by spirals of inflammation that require multiple medications and limit
                    activity. This message of prevention becomes more important to health care delivery with each passing day.</p>
