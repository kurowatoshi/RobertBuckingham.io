            <h2 style="color: #FFC700;"><strong>Title:</strong> How Dancing Really Stops the Clock earns a Seal of Excellence</h2>
            <p style="color: #FFC700;"><strong>By:</strong> PA Book Review</p>
        
            <p>How Dancing Really Stops the Clock: How the Capillary Cell’s Two-Step Dance Anoints Longevity Through a Counterbalanced Rhythm by Dr. Robert L. Buckingham presents the premise that cells, particularly capillary cells, perform and function in rhythms or dance steps. A person’s everyday behaviors have the power to enhance or negate these rhythms and this can determine the health of the cell’s function which in turn can affect overall health, inflammation in the body, and aging. Dr. Buckingham dives in depth to explain this process, how different variables affect health and cell health, and much more.</p>
        
            <p>For the most part, the writing in How Dancing Really Stops the Clock is appropriate for the subject matter and very well done. However, it is extremely formal in tone and style. If the author is hoping to target a larger audience of readers, it might be helpful to include friendlier language and relatable examples. This would make this book much more accessible for the average person.</p>
        
            <p>Dr. Buckingham appears to be very knowledgeable and considering his title, qualified to write on this topic. Readers would most likely appreciate a section with information about the author providing information about his education, research, experience, and accolades. This would provide even more credibility to Dr. Buckingham’s claims and information within How Dancing Really Stops the Clock: How the Capillary Cell’s Two-Step Dance Anoints Longevity Through a Counterbalanced Rhythm.</p>
        
            <p>One thing that does provide credibility to How Dancing Really Stops the Clock is the extensive bibliography provided by the author at the end of the book. The sources seem to peer-reviewed and from trustworthy sources. The appendices located at the front and the back of the book are also quite informative and helpful. There is some confusion related to sources, however. Throughout the book are numbers that seem to refer back to footnotes or endnotes but there are no footnotes or endnotes at the end of each page or the end of each chapter. Including these would provide a more professional book that readers could use to further their own research.</p>
        
            <p>The manuscript is exceptionally clean and free of any grammatical errors. It has been well-proofread and is formatted neatly and clearly. The advanced vocabulary usage is professional and informative but this might be difficult for some readers. The intended audience for this book is most likely readers who are already involved in the medical and science fields. The information within How Dancing Really Stops the Clock is incredibly complex. The average person will most likely struggle to read and comprehend this book on a meaningful level. The information and research seem to be impeccable but the writing is technical in nature and will prove difficult for many readers.</p>
        
            <p>In order for How Dancing Really Stops the Clock: How the Capillary Cell’s Two-Step Dance Anoints Longevity Through a Counterbalanced Rhythm to reach and be understood by more readers, it might be helpful for the author to include clear illustrations depicting the information being shared. Graphs, charts, and data might also prove helpful. Most likely the biggest improvement that could be made to help more readers comprehend the book might be to include anecdotes, examples, personal stories, and more that are relatable for the readers. This is obviously a complex topic and the scientific and medical jargon included would also do well to be replaced with more common words or examples if the goal is to impact more readers than just those in the scientific and medical communities.</p>
        
            <p>How Dancing Really Stops the Clock: How the Capillary Cell’s Two-Step Dance Anoints Longevity Through a Counterbalanced Rhythm by Dr. Robert L. Buckingham earns a four out of five rating for the difficulty that many will have to try to read this book in spite of the outstanding research and information. The author is clearly highly qualified to write this book but this might not be the perfect book for the average reader. The book could also benefit from more clear illustrations and footnotes.</p>
        
            <p>How Dancing Really Stops the Clock: How the Capillary Cell’s Two-Step Dance Anoints Longevity Through a Counterbalanced Rhythm by Dr. Robert L. Buckingham is a well-researched and informative text that those in the medical community and those with an interest in the way the body works will appreciate. While the average reader may struggle, this book is sure to be very helpful for the target audience.</p>
